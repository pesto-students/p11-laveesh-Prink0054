# What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?


A protocol stack or protocol suite is the architecture of a protocol that follows the layered architecture design principle.

The protocols in a stack determine the interconnectivity rules for a layered network model such as in the OSI or TCP/IP models. To become a stack the protocols must be interoperable being able to connect both vertically between the layers of the network and horizontally between the end-points of each transmission segment.


# What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?


**Web Server** : Web server is a program which processes the network requests of the users and serves them with files that create web pages. This exchange takes place using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
Basically, web servers are computers used to store HTTP files which makes a website and when a client requests a certain website, it delivers the requested website to the client. For example, you want to open Facebook on your laptop and enter the URL in the search bar of google. Now, the laptop will send an HTTP request to view the facebook webpage to another computer known as the webserver. This computer (webserver) contains all the files (usually in HTTP format) which make up the website like text, images, gif files, etc. After processing the request, the webserver will send the requested website-related files to your computer and then you can reach the website.

Different websites can be stored on the same or different web servers but that doesn’t affect the actual website that you are seeing in your computer. The web server can be any software or hardware but is usually a software running on a computer. One web server can handle multiple users at any given time which is a necessity otherwise there had to be a web server for each user and considering the current world population, is nearly close to impossible. A web server is never disconnected from the internet because if it was, then it won’t be able to receive any requests, and therefore cannot process them.



There are many web servers available in the market both free and paid. Some of them are described below:

**Apache HTTP server**: It is the most popular web server and about 60 percent of the world’s web server machines run this web server. The Apache HTTP web server was developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is an open-source software which means that we can access and make changes to its code and mold it according to our preference. The Apache Web Server can be installed and operated easily on almost all operating systems like Linux, MacOS, Windows, etc.

**Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)**: IIS (Internet Information Services) is a high performing web server developed by Microsoft. It is strongly united with the operating system and is therefore relatively easier to administer. It is developed by Microsoft, it has a good customer support system which is easier to access if we encounter any issue with the server. It has all the features of the Apache HTTP Server except that it is not an open-source software and therefore its code is inaccessible which means that we cannot make changes in the code to suit our needs. It can be easily installed in any Windows device.

**Lighttpd**: Lighttpd is pronounced as ‘Lightly’. It currently runs about 0.1 percent of the world’s websites. Lighttpd has a small CPU load and is therefore comparatively easier to run. It has a low memory footprint and hence in comparison to the other web servers, requires less memory space to run which is always an advantage. It also has speed optimizations which means that we can optimize or change its speed according to our requirements. It is an open-source software which means that we can access its code and add changes to it according to our needs and then upload our own module (the changed code).

**Jigsaw Server**: Jigsaw has been written in the Java language and it can run CGI (common gateway interference) scripts as well as PHP programs. It is not a full-fledged server and was developed as an experimental server to demonstrate the new web protocols. It is an open-source software which means that we can access its code and add changes to it according to our needs and then upload our own module (the changed code). It can be installed on any device provided that the device supports Java language and modifications in Java.

**Sun Java System**: The Sun Java System supports various languages, scripts, and technologies required for Web 2.0 such as Python, PHP, etc. It is not an open-source software and therefore its code is inaccessible which means that we cannot make changes in the code to suit our needs.


# What is web hosting, and what are the different types of hosting services available for websites?


Web Hosting is a service that allows hosting/post-web-server applications( website or web page ) on a computer system through which web-browser clients can have easy access to electronic content on the Internet.

Different types of Web hosting services are listed below:

**Free Hosting**

**Virtual or Shared Hosting**

**Dedicated Hosting**

**Co-location Hosting**


**Free Hosting**:

This is a free non-paid web hosting service. This type of hosting is available with many prominent sites that offer to host some web pages for no cost, like Hostinger.


Advantages :

Free of cost
Use websites to place advertisements. banners and other forms of advertising media

Disadvantages:
Customer support is missing
Low bandwidth and lesser data transfer
No control over your website


**Shared/Virtual Hosting**:

It’s a web hosting service where many websites reside on one web server connected to the internet. This type of hosting is provided under one’s own domain name, www.yourname.com. With a hosting plan with the web hosting company, one can present oneself as a fully independent identity to his/her web audience, like Lindo.

Advantages:

Easy and affordable
Secured by hosting provider
24/7 Technical support

Disadvantages:
Shared resources can slow down the whole server
Less flexible than dedicated hosting


**Dedicated Hosting**:
Hosted on a dedicated server, this type of hosting is best suited for large websites with high traffic. In this, the company wishing to go online rents an entire web server from a hosting company. This is suitable for companies hosting larger websites, maintaining others’ sites or managing a big online mall, etc like Google Cloud.

Advantages:

Ideal for large business
Strong database support
Unlimited software support
Powerful e-mail solutions
Complete root access to your servers

Disadvantages:

Its very expensive
Requires superior skill sets


**Co-located Hosting**:
This hosting lets you place your own web server on the premises of a service provider. It is similar to that of dedicated hosting except for the fact that the server is now provided by the user-company itself and its physical needs are met by the hosting company like AWS.

Advantages:

Greater Bandwidth High Up-Time
Unlimited Software Options
High Security


Disadvantages:
Difficult to configure and debug
Its expensive
Require high skills

# What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?

The scalability of an application can be measured by the number of requests it can effectively support simultaneously. The point at which an application can no longer handle additional requests effectively is the limit of its scalability. This limit is reached when a critical hardware resource runs out, requiring different or more machines. Scaling these resources can include any combination of adjustments to CPU and physical memory (different or more machines), hard disk (bigger hard drives, less “live” data, solid state drives), and/or the network bandwidth (multiple network interface controllers, bigger NICs, fiber, etc.).

Horizontal scaling means scaling by adding more machines to your pool of resources (also described as “scaling out”), whereas vertical scaling refers to scaling by adding more power (e.g. CPU, RAM) to an existing machine (also described as “scaling up”).

# What is SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and how can web developers optimize their websites for better search engine rankings?


**Search engine optimization (SEO)** is the art and science of getting pages to rank higher in search engines such as Google. Because search is one of the main ways in which people discover content online, ranking higher in search engines can lead to an increase in traffic to a website.


Google’s search algorithm uses more than 200 factors to rank a website. Web developers start by optimizing the following 10 elements to get pages ranking:


**Mobile-friendliness**.  
**Website speed**.   
**Sitemaps**. 
**Readability**.     
**Image file names**.  
**Alt tags**.  
**Website navigation**.  
**URL structure**  
**Metadata**  
**Indexable content**
